       "about":"I'm CJ, Professor of Real Estate at Schack Institute and a Founder of NOYACK, a financial education company impacting the lives of young investors everywhere through financial education, community and universal access to private markets.\n\nI am the son of Italian immigrants,  my father a highly decorated NYFD Fireman who then built one of the largest municipal building companies in New York City. Nancy Reagan gave him an award for his projects. At 16 my father had a stroke and I gave up my dream of playing in the NHL (yeah, right) to manage the family business which I knew nothing about.\n\nThat started a 40 year journey of educating myself through thousands of hours of reading and painful mistakes. But it also turned out to be my life's mission and I wish everyone finds they're purpose and is able to pusue it . I am doing this as a financial educator of young investors after a pretty successful career as the Chief Investment Officer of a nine family investing syndicate; my track record over 30 years doing this is  23% average annual returns.  We invested in: commercial real estate, media IP,  early stage venture capital, private credit, fine art and consumer packaged goods. \n\nThe COVID pandemic was a wake up call  for me to create a more lasting legacy than just money; helping others by providing so I founded NOYACK to educate and mentor  Millennials & Gen Z as they inherit are inheriting $4.4 trillion by 2025 and $39.4 trillion by 2045 - The Great Wealth Transfer How will they make decisions for their future? NOYACK's mission is all about creating a new kind of next-gen investment culture, bringing people together in a community space for young investors to learn, explore, and invest in private markets. \n\nNOYACK and our Noyack Private Investing Club  is becoming a hub, a home, a safe space to learn, interact and access this valuable world of private markets.\n\nI built this for the 19 year old me, CJ, who had no one to ask for help or any place to learn about private investments or a community of like-minded investors and peers with similar interests at a similar place in their lives. My goal is to teach members to fish for themselves so they can build generational wealth. Whether they\u2019re looking to make a small investment or have just inherited a family nest egg they need to protect - we\u2019re here to transform their lives, their kid\u2019s lives and if all goes as planned, their kid\u2019s kid\u2019s lives.\n\nCome join the wealth revolution to end economic inequality - we don't have to do this, we are lucky enough to get to be able to do this. #AccessGranted",

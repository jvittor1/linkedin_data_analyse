In one project, the problem was to route a helicopter that transports crew members to and from offshore gas platforms, where weight and passenger capacity, and flight time constraints must be taken into account. In another project, the problem was to design an optimal logistics network for a branch of the largest Iranian automaker. The problem was to route various types of vehicles to pick up and deliver pallets of products in a network consisting of supplier and assembly plant nodes. I also collaborated in a project aimed at the joint determination of the optimal asset procurement method and its maintenance schedule. The objectives to be optimized are total cost, reliability, and availability. I also worked in the project for optimization of spare parts management at the National Iranian Copper Industries Co. (NICICO). My responsibilities include analyzing and optimizing spare parts inventory level, developing a software tool for forecasting spare parts demand, and analyzing and optimizing the process of spare parts management system.",

        "about": "Even after 3 years of researching and engineering batteries I still find them almost magical. They are essentially nanoscale sponges absorbing practically invisible lithium-ions at the thermodynamic and kinetic limits of the liquid soup of electrolyte transporting them and continue to excite both me for the science and an insanely rapid growing market for their capabilities and hope of a greener future.\n\nIn my current role as a Research Engineer, I get to directly study that magic by researching and developing South 8 Technologies' novel liquefied gas (LiGas) electrolyte ranging from testing various electrolyte formulations/additives to optimizing for specific electrodes or use cases. Concurrently, I help train and educate Research Associates on cell construction and electrochemistry fundamentals, as well as direct cell builds for various projects. I have experience using and interpreting data from cyclic voltametry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), conductivity measurements and general battery cycling (life cycle, rate and temperature capabilities) on Biologic and Maccor cyclers.\n\nI've also had experience conducting UL safety testing, including thermal runaway, temperature, short circuit and overcharge/discharge testing of both modules and packs used in electric vehicles during my time at Flux Power. During my graduate studies, I also extensively studied lithium metal anodes, first authoring a paper on optical in-situ characterization of lithium plating and stripping, took multiple courses on electrochemistry and materials at UC San Diego and established and effectively managed a battery lab at SDSU.\n\nMy background in Mechanical Engineering has also provided a unique ability to critically solve problems through engineering and building practical solutions that are not always available commercially.\n\nAs I continue to grow in my career, I hope to keep learning about the world of electrochemical devices, research and develop interesting new technologies, educate and lead the next generation of innovators and researchers and ultimately help contribute to a greener and cleaner future for us all.",

In addition to the acquired experience with traditional project management techniques during that period, I also learned invaluable communication skills through dealing with project owners, engineers, workers, and other stakeholders across the organization.\n\nI‚Äôll be graduating May, 2021 and I plan to pursue a career in business analytics. I am motivated to find a position where I can help a company achieve its goals and create value through a data driven approach. In the meantime, I will be further developing my skillset and expanding my professional connections network. Please do not hesitate to connect with me for any inquiries or any potential job opportunities.",

I have two siblings, both sisters born June 19th, 1990 and September 6th, 1993. Raised within 30 miles of my hometown. Absolutely enjoyed/excelled at math (geometry, trig, algebra, calculus) and physics growing up. Would love to eventually go to college to get a degree in astrophysics, quantum mechanics, add infinitum. \n\nI love learning new information about almost anything and am a wealth of random knowledge, but my favorites are physics/software technology, the world, universe. I love learning how everything works down to a base/component level and almost whenever posed with a question about any of the above, I will try to find the answer by any means (books, YouTube, Google etc). If I need to know something to complete a task and don't, or just want to know more information, Google or YouTube. If I believe it to possibly be in the public domain and I don't know how something works or how to do something, I will without shame open Google and search until I find it, or sufficient searches have been done to show it is not easily obtainable through those channels in which case I will turn to a supervisor. Some would tell me to do that first, but supervisors have their own jobs and I feel it unfair to bother them with a question at my level if I couldn't be bothered to do the initial search for the answer myself. All that being said I don't believe everything I see or hear and will frequently try to find multiple sources dictating the same info before stating it with confidence. \n\nMental Health issues may take my mind off track every once in a while but if I hyper-focus on a task, and am given the breathing space to execute, I will perform on average better than my peers. Some of my strengths would be attentiveness to detail, my adaptation to change, and my adequate timeliness on competing tasks. I'm usually in the top 2-3 performers when viewing technical job performance (servers, printers, workstations, switches/routers, basic IT/work related knowledge etc). My weaknesses would be effective direct (face to face) communication as I usually need to preface conversations before I have them, my inability to accept change for the sake of change, and my work-arrival timeliness as some of my health conditions make my sleep patterns variable, especially when on regular shifts.",

I have worked in multiple customer service roles and have become a self-proclaimed master at making a positive impact on those I speak to.

        "about": "Short version: I study computer science because I‚Äôve always enjoyed puzzles and logic, which implies that pursuing CS will lead to a life of enjoyment. I haven't rigorously and mathematically proved that statement, but to put it bluntly, \"it's cool as heck!\"\n\nHere are my projects: https://ctwobosius.github.io/TheWongFireside/projects.html\n\nI've done some cool things with Argo AI, automating tasks and developing GPU libraries, and with Breakout mentors, where I taught game development.\n\n\nThe story:\n\nFor 18 years, I wandered through school without direction, able to find my way through the maze, traversing through writing, art, math, animation, economics, law, history, mechanical drafting, martial arts, but never able to piece together why I wandered the maze, how the paths and experiences all connected together. \n\nIt wasn't until I stumbled across a Python YouTube tutorial that I was launched into the exciting world of computer science - where math, English, everything began fitting together - culminating into a skill that shapes the very future of this Earth on a scale that is ever increasing as technology progresses. \n\nAs I dove deeper into computer science, I found myself with a tool able to turn thoughts into reality, the vast, complicated world into understandable models - from Python to C++, HTML to SQL, the possibilities were limitless. This discovery opened up my dream to become that \"YouTube tutorial,\" that inspiration which replaces goalless meandering with fruitful purpose. Whether that is achieved by developing technology that solves today's problems, or empowering others to do the same, I hope my work betters myself and others, paving a path to a brighter future.",

In this time I have found a love of data entry that I never expected. \n\nOptimally, I would love to find a career path where I can create, maintain, and analyze data. That option failing, I would also greatly enjoy the ability to help people and organize information/schedules. Despite having a limited variety of experience, I consider myself a jack of trades. I enjoy trying many new things and learn new concepts rapidly; this means that I am a prime candidate for you to instruct me on how YOU want things done.

I am firm believer in the transformative power of creativity and storytelling as a way to propel teams to success.\n\nAt the University of Ottawa, I learnt from experienced professionals about issues in Political Science, Sociology, and Statistics. I polished my presentation and public speaking skills by being part of clubs such as the Model United Nations, and attended the House of Commons at the Canadian Parliament to deliver a speech on policy-making. Taking courses in business management and financial accounting helped me sharpen my skills in financial modeling. Besides that, as part of the editing team of the Undergraduate Journal of Politics, Policy and Society (UJPPS), I had the privilege to serve as an editor for an outstanding academic journal.\n\nI work best in creative spaces that foster innovation. For instance, at the Levy Economics Institute, we build strong cross-functional project squads and learn quickly by empirically testing research ideas. At this think tank, I had the fantastic opportunity to work with professionals analyzing trends in poverty and inequality, which taught me how to connect data analysis insights with real-life applications. Several of the projects we worked on required a lot of accuracy in its execution and to acquire a great level of attention to detail.  I honed my skills in data visualization and interpreting models in a critical way. These skills are highly transferable to fields such as finance, business management, technology, among others. \n\nI have worked with SMEs in the arrangements for expansion plans, including the process of incorporating a company in foreign jurisdictions, from crafting shareholder agreements to implementing the most tax efficient structure. Besides that, I was able to provide to my clients a reduction of ~3% in the cost of raw material by auditing supplier agreements. Furthermore, I Implemented and streamlined data management procedures, improving operational efficiency by 8%.\n\nMy five-year plan includes gaining expertise in valuation of assets and sourcing of investment opportunities. I also write several articles on matters related to finance, technology, and innovation, which you can find in the link in my profile.",

In the chemistry special program, I had the opportunity to broaden my knowledge in all branches of undergraduate chemistry, which reinforced and solidified my intense interest in chemistry.\n\nI also had the opportunity to complete an industrial training project as a chemist in training at Raigam Marketing Services (Pvt) Ltd, Sri Lanka. That training program gave me a lot of exposure to industrial chemistry while allowing me to further enhance my interpersonal skills.\n\nCurrently, I am pursuing my graduate studies at Wayne State University, and working under the supervision of Dr. C. N. Verani. I have been working on two projects; One project is developing nanoscale rectification devices using first row transition metal complexes and the other project is based on developing Langmuir-Blodgett films for corrosion inhibition. My research on different fields has afforded me proficiency in electrochemistry, organic synthesis, LB surface deposition, in addition to an array of characterization techniques including NMR, FTIR, HPLC, LCMS, GC, SEM, UV-vis, CV, Tafel, EIS.\n\nI have always enjoyed teaching, and as a teaching assistant and instructor, I am in the process of enhancing my interpersonal skills in guiding, directing, assisting, and teaching students.",

On the other side, government partners trust my ability to recognize their uniquely positioned issues and take the lead in devising and executing complex strategy, so they can focus on the daily tactics of their critical roles.\n\nMy collaboration approach includes finding connection points with team members and customers across all levels and functions to build rapport, earn trust, and gain an intimate understanding of an organization through the eyes of its people. I take this macro level approach to identify what a business/institution is dealing with and how that plays into the larger picture of its mission, so I can deliver specialized knowledge and open new perspectives around government and security topics.  \n\nFrom working with cross-cultural teams to understanding the geopolitical climate of various regions, the work I do is inherently global in nature and I believe joining forces with people of varying backgrounds, viewpoints, and areas of expertise is a catalyst to real game-changing innovation and impact.  \n\nI consider my recent selection as a Class of 2021 Presidential Innovation Fellow the culmination of my career success. As an ‚Äúentrepreneur in residence‚Äù for one year, I was chosen for executive-level expertise, innovation, influence, and problem-solving dexterity.

Throughout the research process it taught me how to find documents while also teaching me to critically analyze the information I researched.  \n\nSince joining the professional world, I was hired on with Liberty Mutual Insurance as an Advanced College Hire (ACH). I have held numerous titles and roles within personal insurance claims during my time with Liberty Mutual. I began working as an auto physical damage claims representative and shortly transitioned into an auto damage appraiser. After a year in that role, I transitioned to being a bodily injury adjuster where I currently handle minor complex claims and litigation. Daily I use critical thinking to analyze medical records and bills to evaluate claims as well to investigate liability, and develop an action plan and strategy to resolve the claim.",

The majority of my work has been done in Java, utilizing Spring to implement micro-services or software as a service patterns, and I've started utilizing Go for greenfield projects. I have experience building mobile applications, mostly developing back-end services for the projects like the Sprint Football Live (NFL) app, NASCAR Sprint Cup Mobile app and the NBA 2 Go app. I've also developed privacy preserving authentication/authorization applications where I created a SAML Identity Provider (IDP) which was used by customers to quickly integrate their systems with our \"Trust Network\" A&A app, while also implementing diverse authentication technologies from Facial recognition (utilizing ShuftiPro) to WebAuthn or U2F, and many, many more. I'm more productive as a back-end developer because of my mediocre graphic design skills but if there are design specs available I can turn them into functioning user interfaces. I enjoy working at the front end every bit as much as I enjoy server side work, but for me front end work is a highly iterative process, and that can be timely.\n\nTechnologies: Java, Go, Node.js, JavaScript, Maven, Spring, grails, groovy, JPA, Hibernate, MySql, Oracle, mongoDB, Micro-services, Docker, Tomcat, Weblogic, JSON, JSON-LD, XML, XSD, JUnit, Selenium, Mockito, SAML, OIDC, XACML, jQuery, Bootstrap, Git, JIRA, U2F, Webauthn",

I loved watching and helping my mom in the kitchen, and now, that curiosity has developed into a professional interest in the intersection of food, writing, and design.\n\nFrom planning retreats for 30 guys to keeping the $40,000 budget for my debate team's travel in the green, college has given me great opportunities to learn how to delegate tasks and support team members.  My humanities degree has guided me in learning to critically assess sources, conduct thorough research, and write in a range of styles.  Along the way, protecting the space to eat and play board games with friends has kept me grounded and revealed how much I value the connecting power of food.\n\nIn internships, I have edited website pages and content in WordPress, designed social media ad campaigns, and taught English classes to over 20 Czech youth.  I am looking forward to continue sharpening punchy writing and cultivating an eye for smart design, and I am thankful for the home that has brought me here.\n\nIf you need a cooking partner, flexible writer, or careful eye that cares about the little things, please reach out; I would love to hear about you and your home.",

My academic interest can be understood through a drive to bridge science and physical, cultural history as a scientist whose interests are driven by a strong background in archiving and anthropology. As a Ph.D. student in physical chemistry at UC Santa Barbara, I am using the research field of gas phase spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to investigate cultural questions such as 'What did the ancient Mayans drink?\" and \"What does that knowledge tell me about their culture?\" Using modern analysis techniques with low limits of detection and high sensitivity, we are able to quantify drink residues in pottery fragments from the Mayan era in order to understand the class stratification and diverse trade networks.\n\nFields like anthropology or archeology often seek to understand the multifaceted complexities of defining and understanding a community through the analysis of personal experience, observation, written record, and conversation. Scientific tools and approaches often can support these narratives and expedite our narrative construction. I believe that scientific methods can serve as better tools to illuminate history and aid minority and disadvantaged groups commonly neglected in society‚Äôs narratives. \n\nThe collaboration of analytical scientific techniques with experts in the fields of art and archeology to dictate the effect of these findings on cultural narratives, is the focus of my Ph.D. and hopefully of my larger career.",

Sp√§ter nutzte ich die Gelegenheit Erfahrungen im Bereich Sonderfahrzeugbau zu sammeln und meine Kenntnisse in der Montage zu vertiefen. Abteilungs√ºbergreifende Zusammenarbeit, Flexibilit√§t sowie ein hoher Qualit√§tsanspruch waren stets gefordert. W√§hrend meiner Weiterbildung zum staatlich gepr√ºften Techniker Fachrichtung Maschinentechnik, im Rahmen meines Begabtenstipendiums, konnte ich weitere Perspektiven entdecken. Ich lernte hier Zusammenh√§nge ganzheitlich zu betrachten und situativ zu bewerten. Diese F√§higkeit konnte ich erstmals bei meiner Abschlussarbeit einsetzen und ein konstruktives Projekt umsetzen. Aktuell konstruiere ich verschiedene Module einer Produktionsmaschine, hierbei kann ich meine bisherigen Erfahrungen einbringen und gleichzeitig Neues im Konstruktionsprozess lernen.",

For my local AHMP chapter, I organized a career event for college students in STEM programs in collaboration with EHS-related organizations (ASSP, AIHA, and others), which promoted our industry, the benefits of credentials and certifications, and the efficacy of both career and leadership development. \n\nMy interests span the topics of geopolitics, sustainability, science and technology, food and health, business, and the outdoors.",

        "about": "Born and raised in Brazil, I moved to the U.S. when I was 18 years-old fresh out of high school. Being an Au Pair helped me get acquainted with the language, culture and the American life style, prepping me for the road ahead. I then started my academic journey: an Associate‚Äôs degree in Business, then a Bachelor‚Äôs in Business and finally after a 3 year break, a Master‚Äôs in Business and Technology Management. During that time, I continued to work full time to put myself through school: I was a nanny for a few years, then started working for my in laws at their car shop and non-profit mission, and after that I did debt collection for a while. After I graduated with my Bachelor‚Äôs, I landed my first corporate job through the Carreer center at my school. Even though some may say this was the beginning of my professional journey, I think this was just a milestone in my professional journey. I have been working since I was 15 and to me work is not defined by my job title, but rather, it is the deep desire of accomplishing whatever task is at hand with my best possible effort. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I am a nanny or a business analyst, my drive to get the job done will always be what keeps me focused. I treasure hard work and believe that we all have what it takes within ourselves to achieve our dreams. Quitting is not in my vocabulary and impossible is just a matter of perspective. I may not have the most prestigious resume but what I do have is passion and that cannot be taught by any institution. It can only be learned in the school of life.",

Since those early days, I have steadily honed my craft to produce software of uncompromising accuracy, speed, and directness of usability.\n\nThe best tools are built by those who use tools. My early work in non-imaging optical analysis software was born of my work in designing life-critical lighting systems for the operating table. Today, I spend hundreds of hours a year engaged in digital astrophotography. This hobby has yielded dozens of techniques, algorithms, and usability ideas that feed my professional work of building sophisticated analytics to extract insight from geospatial imagery and related data.\n\nAs my career has matured, I have developed the skill of operating at higher levels of abstraction, evolving from software engineer to software architect. Today, my favorite challenges usually center on taking on a complex problem, identifying big picture patterns, and organizing an effective blend of new and existing technology to meet the challenge.  I have a gift for deconstructing and explaining complex problems clearly, but I also still enjoy getting down to the ‚Äúnitty-gritty‚Äù details to solve those problems.  \n\nWhen I‚Äôm not building software or processing astrophotography images, I enjoy travelling, mountaineering here in Colorado, listening to and learning about music, and going on long bike rides.",

In collaboration with parents, educators, and small businesses who host La Puente Mini Maker kits, I research, curate, and put together STEM and art-based kits to encourage kids to learn, create, and explore new ideas, while encouraging families to support small businesses in our community. In just a few months, I put together over 1,500 kits for kids to take home and have expanded from three small businesses hosting kits to five. From starting La Puente Mini Makers, I have learned the importance of empathy and compassion that are invaluable in designing experiences that are meaningful, inclusive, delightful, efficient, and equitable for users.\n\nCurrently, I am seeking a remote or on-site Experience Designer position with an established UX team that will provide mentorship and the opportunity to use my past experiences, while also enhancing my skill set.",

I achieve this by leveraging my engineering expertise, identifying faults, and utilizing rootcause analysis techniques. Additionally, I am adept at using cutting-edge tools and engineering design and analysis skills.\nMost recently, for instance, as a Vehicle Evaluator at Roush, I exceeded my goal to find 3 faults per vehicle. I achieved this by carefully evaluating vehicle performance, conducting secondary research to keep common vehicle issues in mind, and overexerting the vehicle. My feedback and fault identification spurred critical quality improvements for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) prototype vehicles. Moreover, I also benchmarked vehicles for product validation and improvement here.\n\nI am passionate about vehicle safety and design improvements. During my master‚Äôs in industrial engineering, I undertook a project to recommend product improvements for an airbag design. I approached this project using the Six Sigma Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) tool and quickly identified the propellant used for airbag deployment as the cause of product degradation. then recommended two viable solutions‚Äîa new and improved, tubular airbag design as well as an alternative material for the propellant.\n\nMy interest in vehicles and taking on new challenges extends to creating go-karts and racing cars and participating in competitions. I was part of a team that ranked in the top 60 out of 200 teams for a Formula SAE SUPRA event. For this project, I undertook the responsibility to resolve powertrain mounting issues. I also helped with the design and fabrication of the chassis. I also co-built a single-passenger electric go-kart operated via battery for the Eco-Kart Series.\n\nIf you are interested in working with someone who identifies and fixes engineering issues through industrial and mechanical testing and design strategies, I can be reached via email: abdulmuqeeth631@gmail.com\n\nKey Skills: Solution Development «Ä Process & Efficiency Improvements «Ä Engineering Analysis «Ä 3D Modeling",

Whether you realize it or not everyone faces challenges daily and how each person faces these challenges is what makes a person unique. I see engineering the same way, a challenge that someone needs to solve and that is the reason I found myself loving engineering. The word ‚ÄúEngineering‚Äù seems complicated and difficult to comprehend to most; however, for me, I see it as a means of expressing my creativity to the problem and the solution is the art.\n\nCollege is similar in a way, we are given a set of problems from our professors to find our creativity to the problem and how each student approach the problem was different. These differences could lead to innovations that could greatly impact the world.\n\nFor my first professional project, I was allowed to develop an alternative to Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This project was conducted with a ground of using equipment that was available to us at the time. After a couple of months of design work, the prototype was complete. The Prototype was not at all what the client had hope for; nonetheless, the client was ecstatic with how it functions which had provided a new approach to the problem and from there a new potential to the finished product. This is what keeps me going, an endless cycle that will continuously create innovation.\n\nThe most important thing that school has taught me is that education is a means to an end, we must always pursue what each value as important. Most importantly, in my life, I see that I majored in mechanical and electrical engineering to broaden my creativity to approach the problem and this will help me become someone who is inspiring.",

Build high-performance teams by leading people that are different from you. \n\nWhen's the last time you had a review and you walked out concentrating on the negative and not the positive? If you could just improve in that one area, I'd be a rock star! \n\nWhat if you flipped that and looked at what you could improve in your strong areas? \n\nI love to help people see things that they should be seeing. This allows them to unlock their full potential and begin to live their life on purpose.\n\nMy mission is to help people embrace their own personal blindness to achieve a greater vision. The process takes people from a point of blindness, into sight, and toward a greater vision.   \n\nI was born and raised in Northwest Ohio as the son of a tomato farmer and the youngest of 10 kids. In 1977, at the age of 10, I was diagnosed with hydrocephalus, a brain malformation. Over the course of the next 33 years I experienced several instances of medical issues resulting from this diagnosis. \n\nOn March 4th of 2011, I woke up blind. \n\nOnly brain surgery and multiple eye surgeries have allowed a portion of my sight to return.\n\nSince then, I have become an author of the semi-autobiography book \"Sometimes It DOES Take a Brain Surgeon\".\n\nFollowing surgery, I've realized that I have blind spots that have nothing to do with my vision. My speaking engagements have allowed me to help other people see and eliminate their blind spots, with the help of a letter from my daughter. Participants in my program have also embraced what makes them unique as they have \"winked with Wagner\". Lastly their vision, preferred future, has come into clear focus. \n\nI use my experiences to help the audience to improve their sales, leadership, and lives by teaching them how to see what they're missing as a result of their own blindness. \n\nMy unique process takes people from Blindness to Sight to Vision.

I want to grow with a company that inspires me through its approach to integrating fashion, technology and consumer behavior.\n\nMy work and leadership experiences not only bolstered my interest in analytics but also taught me to be a self-starter and to not be afraid of asking questions.

As a child, I was always encouraged to value my education and to never lose my curiosity to learn more about the world around me. That curiosity then helped me realize how important a child's education is in the early phases of life, which is why I am now a pre-school teacher. My teaching method also stems from this source of curiosity. At the early stages of childhood, all children are extremely curious about the world around them. I then foster that curiosity and use auditory, visual and linguistic teaching methods to help the child further develop the necessary skills they'll need in life and their educational journeys.\n\nI am committed to my students and their families and hope to provide a safe and peaceful environment for them to learn and grow together.",

We are collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) on this project.  My appointment at zeroK NanoTech is enabled by the Small Business Postdoctoral Research Diversity Fellowship from the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE); this is an NSF-supported fellowship.\n\nIn my other recent research I have studied rubidium atoms in highly excited electronic states, known as Rydberg states.  In early 2014 I used their sensitivity to electromagnetic fields to develop an atom-based sensing technique for RF and mm-wave electric fields.  This work was in collaboration with researchers at NIST, Boulder.  In my Ph.D. thesis work I studied the interactions between Rydberg atoms.  These are relevant to quantum information processing, and also play a role in energy transfer in atomic gases.",

I consult or have acted as a consultant for the OECD, The World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and a variety of multinational firms. I have a variety of academic papers and books on corporate governance and governance in state-owned firms.\n\nAs an instructor, I lecture and run executive programs in the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay, Chile, etc. I am also frequently a keynote  speaker at business meetings, on topics that range from economic scenarios and their impact for businesses (e.g., the Harvard Business Review Scenarios Conference in Brazil) to more tailor-made presentations for industry-peak associations (e.g., the Association of Retailers of Brazil) or corporate boards (e.g., Henkel, Femsa, etc.). \n\nI also enjoy being a manager of academic programs. At Harvard Business School I was the chair of their Latin America Advisory Board until early 2014, managing relations with alumni and board members, and leading the efforts of their regional research centers in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. At the International Business School, Brandeis University, I am the Director of the Latin America Initiative and the Brazil Initiative. Thus, I also manage relations with alumni and donors in Latin America, I organize academic programs on campus and academic trips to the region, and, I coordinate the relationship the school has with students and universities in the region. Finally, I am or have been on the board of non-profit education institutions, such as business schools, and more recently at LASPAU, an organization that helps place Latin American students in top programs in the United States.",

In the past few years, I have taught in and cross-listed my courses with the Comparative History of Ideas Department (CHID). I also work closely with the 501 c(3) non-profit organization, University Beyond Bars (UBB), providing educational opportunities at the Monroe Correctional Complex in classroom, workshop, and cultural lectures and series formats. \n\nI'm currently in the final stages of writing my dissertation and completing my PhD program. My project, (Neo)Liberal Logics of Caribbean Sex Tourism, is an interdisciplinary and multilingual study of various representations of sex workers in Caribbean cultural production. By focusing on the ways that sex workers are rendered in literary and filmic media, I illuminate a variety of epistemic practices, characterized as sometimes violent and at other times asserting autonomy that subtend racial capitalism. Divided into two major parts, the first section investigates the modes of violence as well as resistance under liberal formations in Jamaica and Haiti. The latter analyzes those modes under neoliberal formations in the Dominican Republic and Cuba. Altogether, I provide a genealogical account from 1970 into the early 2000s of U.S. imperial or transnational capitalist expansion into the Caribbean under the guise of development and economic restructuring for democratic ends.\n\nIn the 2018-2019 school yeah, I taught with the Comparative History of Ideas Department (CHID) through their Collaborative Learning and Interdisciplinary Pedagogy Fellowship (CLIP). Together with a colleague in English, Caleb Knapp, we designed and taught a 5-course series related to the theme of Critical Justice Studies. I also teach and volunteer in the Monroe Correctional Facility with the amazing non-profit organization, University Beyond Bars.",

        "about": "I remember the first book my dad bought me. It was written in Indonesian and literally translated to ‚ÄúTell Me Why‚Äù.  The book contained simple explanations to questions that children ask, such as ‚ÄúWhy is the ocean so salty‚Äù, or ‚ÄúWhat is the difference between a fruit and a vegetable‚Äù.  Having this book read to me, ignited a sense of curiosity in me since I was little which has never died since.\n\nNow how do I harness this curiosity?  I decided to focus my career in forensics engineering! Interweaving it with my interest in buildings and architecture, I specialise in understanding the root causes and mechanisms that lead to the failures of components and/or systems in the built environment.\n\nThroughout my career, I have inspected over 300 distinct buildings, ranging from single-storey residential dwellings in the outback, to one of the highest residential apartment building in Australia.\n\nThe types of issues that I have diagnosed and repaired, includes the following (to name a few):\n\n\t- Interior and exterior waterproofing membranes\n\t- Combustible cladding\n\t- Building movements induced by reactive clay soils\n\t- Concrete reinforcement spalling \n\t- Glazing elements\n\t- Lightweight cladding\n\t- Parking garages\n\nI am not your regular engineer.  I'm a very visual person and love utilising sketches and diagrams to depict my ideas.  This includes hand-drawn details to computer models for clients and contractors alike.  I am naturally outgoing and have a high level of personal energy!  I love coordination, sharing experiences, and knowledge with others around me which makes me thrive in teams.   \n\nWhen I am not crawling under buildings or hanging out the side of skyscrapers, I enjoy practicing and competing in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, cooking, and reading.\n\nI love a good chat - so don't hesitate to reach out.",

As part of the Honors Academy, my course work was more challenging, allowing me to display my excellence in both the Design and Development project and Senior Capstone project. I was the manufacturing lead at the Rutgers Chapter of AIAA, where I helped build multiple RC planes for AIAA DBF competitions. I actively participate in the Space Technology Association of Rutgers, and have led several projects, most notably an expedition to capture data from a satellite with an RF antenna. I am also a member of Operation Space, the first intercollegiate team of students planning to break the Karman line. We hope to launch sometime soon.\n\nI‚Äôd like to use my knowledge and skills to pursue a career in Design, Manufacturing or Quality Control. My experience has taught me that production processes have a massive effect on the outcome of any project. I find it exciting that as an engineer I have the unique opportunity to change the world.\n\nCompletely trivial fact:  One of my hobbies is playing chess. The fact that each move is a new decision branching out into endless possibilities is exhilarating. Much like in engineering, every choice has trade-offs.",

I started as receptionist, moved into a position as a legal secretary/notary public and, now that I have earned my AA and Paralegal Certificate, I have moved into a position as a paralegal. I previously assisted in preparing estate planning documents, business entity formations documents, and funded clients' assets to their trusts. I now still complete some of the more complex funding tasks, assist with Trust and Estate Administrations (document preparation, asset gathering, client communications,etc.), probates, conservatorships and guardianships, and perform various administrative/secretarial tasks (mail sorting/delivery, supply ordering, filing, organizing, etc.). In addition to working full time, I volunteer at my children's schools whenever possible to assist in events/activities. I enjoy spending time with my family (husband, three children, dog, bearded dragon and squirrel tree frog), going on hikes and working out. Oh yes, and I am an avid coffee/tea lover!

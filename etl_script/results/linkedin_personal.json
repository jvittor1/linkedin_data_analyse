They are essentially nanoscale sponges absorbing practically invisible lithium-ions at the thermodynamic and kinetic limits of the liquid soup of electrolyte transporting them and continue to excite both me for the science and an insanely rapid growing market for their capabilities and hope of a greener future.\n\nIn my current role as a Research Engineer, I get to directly study that magic by researching and developing South 8 Technologies' novel liquefied gas (LiGas) electrolyte ranging from testing various electrolyte formulations/additives to optimizing for specific electrodes or use cases. Concurrently, I help train and educate Research Associates on cell construction and electrochemistry fundamentals, as well as direct cell builds for various projects. I have experience using and interpreting data from cyclic voltametry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), conductivity measurements and general battery cycling (life cycle, rate and temperature capabilities) on Biologic and Maccor cyclers.\n\nI've also had experience conducting UL safety testing, including thermal runaway, temperature, short circuit and overcharge/discharge testing of both modules and packs used in electric vehicles during my time at Flux Power. During my graduate studies, I also extensively studied lithium metal anodes, first authoring a paper on optical in-situ characterization of lithium plating and stripping, took multiple courses on electrochemistry and materials at UC San Diego and established and effectively managed a battery lab at SDSU.\n\nMy background in Mechanical Engineering has also provided a unique ability to critically solve problems through engineering and building practical solutions that are not always available commercially.\n\nAs I continue to grow in my career, I hope to keep learning about the world of electrochemical devices, research and develop interesting new technologies, educate and lead the next generation of innovators and researchers and ultimately help contribute to a greener and cleaner future for us all.",

I write about some of my personal projects here: https://medium.com/@azaanbarlas\n\nI have been interested in data analytics since 2018, being introduced through a mandatory business course I took about databases. I loved how challenging it was, so I ended up taking programming courses and learning about data science in my free time. \n\nI have extensive experience with Data Visualization as well and have done some automation in my recent work experiences. I love talking to people who are in this field, and I would love to learn more about how I can contribute positively to the world with these tools.\n\nAside from data analytics, I like learning about NFTs, as well as stocks and fixed-income. I also am a huge soccer nerd, especially in German and Italian soccer.\n\nKeywords: Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, data analytics, data science, data engineering, automation,",

        "about": "Hello potential boss!\nI'll \"BLUF\" (Bottom line up front) this by saying openly that I have ADHD, so my apologies for the tangential, wordy mess that will be most of what you read here.\n\nI was born May 21st, 1992 in Richfield, Utah to my father Bret Baum and my mother Laurie Mitchell. I have two siblings, both sisters born June 19th, 1990 and September 6th, 1993. Raised within 30 miles of my hometown. Absolutely enjoyed/excelled at math (geometry, trig, algebra, calculus) and physics growing up. Would love to eventually go to college to get a degree in astrophysics, quantum mechanics, add infinitum. \n\nI love learning new information about almost anything and am a wealth of random knowledge, but my favorites are physics/software technology, the world, universe. I love learning how everything works down to a base/component level and almost whenever posed with a question about any of the above, I will try to find the answer by any means (books, YouTube, Google etc). If I need to know something to complete a task and don't, or just want to know more information, Google or YouTube. If I believe it to possibly be in the public domain and I don't know how something works or how to do something, I will without shame open Google and search until I find it, or sufficient searches have been done to show it is not easily obtainable through those channels in which case I will turn to a supervisor. Some would tell me to do that first, but supervisors have their own jobs and I feel it unfair to bother them with a question at my level if I couldn't be bothered to do the initial search for the answer myself. All that being said I don't believe everything I see or hear and will frequently try to find multiple sources dictating the same info before stating it with confidence. \n\nMental Health issues may take my mind off track every once in a while but if I hyper-focus on a task, and am given the breathing space to execute, I will perform on average better than my peers. Some of my strengths would be attentiveness to detail, my adaptation to change, and my adequate timeliness on competing tasks. I'm usually in the top 2-3 performers when viewing technical job performance (servers, printers, workstations, switches/routers, basic IT/work related knowledge etc). My weaknesses would be effective direct (face to face) communication as I usually need to preface conversations before I have them, my inability to accept change for the sake of change, and my work-arrival timeliness as some of my health conditions make my sleep patterns variable, especially when on regular shifts.",

I haven't rigorously and mathematically proved that statement, but to put it bluntly, \"it's cool as heck!\"\n\nHere are my projects: https://ctwobosius.github.io/TheWongFireside/projects.html\n\nI've done some cool things with Argo AI, automating tasks and developing GPU libraries, and with Breakout mentors, where I taught game development.\n\n\nThe story:\n\nFor 18 years, I wandered through school without direction, able to find my way through the maze, traversing through writing, art, math, animation, economics, law, history, mechanical drafting, martial arts, but never able to piece together why I wandered the maze, how the paths and experiences all connected together. \n\nIt wasn't until I stumbled across a Python YouTube tutorial that I was launched into the exciting world of computer science - where math, English, everything began fitting together - culminating into a skill that shapes the very future of this Earth on a scale that is ever increasing as technology progresses. \n\nAs I dove deeper into computer science, I found myself with a tool able to turn thoughts into reality, the vast, complicated world into understandable models - from Python to C++, HTML to SQL, the possibilities were limitless. This discovery opened up my dream to become that \"YouTube tutorial,\" that inspiration which replaces goalless meandering with fruitful purpose. Whether that is achieved by developing technology that solves today's problems, or empowering others to do the same, I hope my work betters myself and others, paving a path to a brighter future.",

With an excessive amount of free time during the last three years, I have spent much of it helping a gaming website moderate their forums and populate the content on their site. In this time I have found a love of data entry that I never expected. \n\nOptimally, I would love to find a career path where I can create, maintain, and analyze data. That option failing, I would also greatly enjoy the ability to help people and organize information/schedules. Despite having a limited variety of experience, I consider myself a jack of trades. I enjoy trying many new things and learn new concepts rapidly; this means that I am a prime candidate for you to instruct me on how YOU want things done. I just need the opportunity to show you that I can do it.",

I am firm believer in the transformative power of creativity and storytelling as a way to propel teams to success.\n\nAt the University of Ottawa, I learnt from experienced professionals about issues in Political Science, Sociology, and Statistics. I polished my presentation and public speaking skills by being part of clubs such as the Model United Nations, and attended the House of Commons at the Canadian Parliament to deliver a speech on policy-making. Taking courses in business management and financial accounting helped me sharpen my skills in financial modeling. Besides that, as part of the editing team of the Undergraduate Journal of Politics, Policy and Society (UJPPS), I had the privilege to serve as an editor for an outstanding academic journal.\n\nI work best in creative spaces that foster innovation. For instance, at the Levy Economics Institute, we build strong cross-functional project squads and learn quickly by empirically testing research ideas. At this think tank, I had the fantastic opportunity to work with professionals analyzing trends in poverty and inequality, which taught me how to connect data analysis insights with real-life applications. Several of the projects we worked on required a lot of accuracy in its execution and to acquire a great level of attention to detail.  I honed my skills in data visualization and interpreting models in a critical way. These skills are highly transferable to fields such as finance, business management, technology, among others. \n\nI have worked with SMEs in the arrangements for expansion plans, including the process of incorporating a company in foreign jurisdictions, from crafting shareholder agreements to implementing the most tax efficient structure. Besides that, I was able to provide to my clients a reduction of ~3% in the cost of raw material by auditing supplier agreements. Furthermore, I Implemented and streamlined data management procedures, improving operational efficiency by 8%.\n\nMy five-year plan includes gaining expertise in valuation of assets and sourcing of investment opportunities. I also write several articles on matters related to finance, technology, and innovation, which you can find in the link in my profile.",

I studied Chemistry, Polymer Science & Technology and Physics as principle subjects. In the chemistry special program, I had the opportunity to broaden my knowledge in all branches of undergraduate chemistry, which reinforced and solidified my intense interest in chemistry.\n\nI also had the opportunity to complete an industrial training project as a chemist in training at Raigam Marketing Services (Pvt) Ltd, Sri Lanka. That training program gave me a lot of exposure to industrial chemistry while allowing me to further enhance my interpersonal skills.\n\nCurrently, I am pursuing my graduate studies at Wayne State University, and working under the supervision of Dr. C. N. Verani. I have been working on two projects; One project is developing nanoscale rectification devices using first row transition metal complexes and the other project is based on developing Langmuir-Blodgett films for corrosion inhibition. My research on different fields has afforded me proficiency in electrochemistry, organic synthesis, LB surface deposition, in addition to an array of characterization techniques including NMR, FTIR, HPLC, LCMS, GC, SEM, UV-vis, CV, Tafel, EIS.\n\nI have always enjoyed teaching, and as a teaching assistant and instructor, I am in the process of enhancing my interpersonal skills in guiding, directing, assisting, and teaching students.",

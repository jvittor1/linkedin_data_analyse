Through a combination of hard work, sound instincts, and incredible passion, the brothers grew their business from a single street cart to a premier sports lifestyle brand that uniquely melds sport and style. \r\n\r\n’47 is a proud partner of the MLB, NFL, NHL, NBA, MLS, MLL, and over 900 collegiate programs.",

Strategies that give my clients a high Return on Investment from the start by incorporating the perfect balance of high traffic and relevancy. I am so confident in my services, I will never ask for a contract. I believe that performance outweighs a contract any day.\n\nGoogle Ads is truly a passion to me. I have worked with Google Ads for almost 7 years, and I still find it as rewarding as I did in the beginning. I have always enjoyed the challenge of Google Ads. It is a highly in depth marketing platform that can perform like a well-oiled marketing machine, or like a black hole that sucks money into a never returning abyss. Obviously, everyone wants it to perform like a well-oiled marketing machine, not a money sucking black hole. This is where strategy comes in. It takes strategy that can only be developed through thousands of hours of working with Google Ads and thousands of dollars of ad spend.\n\nThe strategies that I have developed over the years are what I give my clients, making certain they get a high ROI for their marketing dollars.",

Our virtual waiting room solution sends patients a website link that shows them when they're expected to be seen and allows them to check-in from the parking lot when they have arrived. Once check-in is completed, our site alerts the staff that their patient is on the premises.  Now, patients can wait remotely and enter the appointment once the exam room is ready, eliminating the need for the waiting room and minimizing the risk of patient interaction to increase patient safety. Our technology complements the office workflow, allowing clinic staff to be more efficient and providing safety and clear communication to the patient.",

        "description": "100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) is dedicated to helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century.   100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just the shocks – earthquakes, fires, floods, etc – but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical basis.  Examples of these stresses include high unemployment; an overtaxed or inefficient public transportation system; endemic violence; or chronic food and water shortages.  By addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city becomes more able to respond to adverse events, and is overall better able to deliver basic functions in both good times and bad, to all populations.  Cities in the 100RC network are provided with the resources along four main pathways: 1) Financial and logistical guidance for establishing an innovative new position in city government, a Chief Resilience Officer, who will lead the city’s resilience efforts; 2) Expert support for development of a robust resilience building strategy; 3) Access to solutions, service providers, and partners from the private, public and NGO sectors who can help them develop and implement their resilience strategies; and 4) Membership in a global network of member cities who can learn from and help each other. Through these offerings, 100RC aims not only help individual cities become more resilient, but to facilitate the creation of a global practice of resilience building.100 Resilient Cities is financially supported by The Rockefeller Foundation and managed as a sponsored project by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors (RPA), an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that provides governance and operational infrastructure to its sponsored projects.",

        "description": "Imagine 100 days playing 100 different golf courses as you travel across the country.  It is every golfer’s dream…or nightmare.  Starting March of 2019 in San Diego and ending in Boston on June 19th, The Longest Day, that is what I will be undertaking…for a very good cause.  To raise awareness and money for the Alzheimer’s Association, I will travel across the country, playing golf at 100 different courses in 100 days with celebrities, golf pros, regular golfers (all skill levels are welcome).  I will be playing with anyone who can help the cause.\n\nAlzheimer’s impacts 6 million Americans and 1 in 3 seniors.  It is a devastating disease not only for the patients but for their caregivers who are often family members.  Almost everyone knows someone who has been affected by this devastating disease.\n\nWorking with local partners and national sponsors to talk about this disease we expect to reach over 100,000 people every day.  Partner and sponsors social media platforms, web sites and email marketing platforms will help publicize the events and generate significant local and national media attention.  Our goal is to raise over $1,000,000 for research and care.\n\nI will be playing everyday;  rain, wind, heat, or whatever comes my way, if the course is open I am playing.  I will play a course or two in each city and then hit the road to find the next course.  I am looking to find foursomes and tournaments that will bring people together to raise awareness of Alzheimer’s and get the word out.  We will be joined by celebrities, sports stars, and local heroes to have some fun on the course.",

        "description": "The Atlanta-based entrepreneurial team behind 101 Concepts relies on the dynamic combination of friendship and shared worked ethic for their successful partnership. The group came together through their Brooklyn backgrounds – meeting as busboys at a New York restaurant and as roommates at Iona College. Luckily for diners in the Southeast, those shared experiences led them to find their niche in friendly, neighborhood restaurants and pubs in Atlanta and Rosemary Beach, Florida. Steve Buero and Chris Segal opened SOHO in September 1997 and showed a knack for bringing the right concept to the right area. Next, the partners, along with Phil Roness, went Irish with Meehan’s Public House in October 2002. There are now five Meehan’s locations throughout Metro Atlanta (Vinings, Downtown, Sandy Springs, Buckhead and Atlantic Station). After opening Sandy Springs staples Cibo e Beve and Food 101 and Castleberry Hill barbecue joint Smoke Ring, the crew decided to take their hospitality to the beach, obtaining Rosemary Beach’s Restaurant Paradis in 2014. In spring 2016, their dreams of owning a steakhouse finally came true with the opening of 101 Steak in Vinings. Don't be fooled by the name, although the \"101\" restaurants are indeed approachable, they are far from basic.",

We came to the idea in June of 2018 to organize a performance auto parts business under the umbrella of knowledge that our original crew members held in the industry.  From our own personal experience, it was difficult to track down reliable service from retailers who could accurately suggest appropriate upgrades with the product knowledge to back their choices. We, as a team, truly hope to change the auto part industry and set a standard for the service expected from auto part retailers in the future. We are always open to new members applying for sponsorship to the 10 Second Racing crew as well as fans looking to stay up to date with the events we will be attending in your area. As our original club motto stated, we ask you, our loyal fan, ‘What’s your 10 second car?’.",

The internet has completely changed how consumers can buy and sell homes, and that’s a good thing.

But somehow, the way real estate is being transacted and the fees charged have not fully caught up to it.\n\nWe understand that the digital age has changed the real estate world, and with that - realtor fees should be adjusted to help the consumer. Our company’s goal is to serve the greater Chicago area with a full-service real estate brokerage that can utilize today’s modern technology, offer streamlined digital processes, all while helping sellers and buyers save thousands of dollars on real estate fees.\n\nHow so? Buyers get cash back for purchasing a home with 103 Realty, and sellers can take advantage of our reduced-cost listing program that’s packed with inclusions. Whether you are buying or selling a home, 103 Realty will help consumers save thousands of dollars.\n\nOur clients will also get to take advantage of our streamlined approach which includes paperless processes, cloud-based storage, access to our network of real estate professionals, plus our own in-house marketing team, and so much more.\n\n103 Realty’s goal is to be one of the top real estate companies in Chicago.

We help investors navigate through the unknown aspects like Pooling and Servicing Agreements or the mysterious behind the scenes activities in the online auction process. In addition, 1619 Capital Partners created a platform for borrowers that are in special servicing to find the debt or equity they need so that new money can be brought into a deal. We’ve set up a network of lenders that specialize in broken CMBS lending and by partnering with them we connect borrowers to the capital sources they need to get back on track, stabilizing their properties with a chance at obtaining their original vision of a return on their investment. We are the Investor’s Advocate. There is a lot of opportunity to find good commercial real estate investments, but unless you understand the inner workings of special servicing, it’s not an easy course to navigate. 1619 Capital Partners provides that expertise.",

We take great pride in carrying on the rich heritage and traditions of the region by providing real support to the community, through our world class financial services and employees' volunteerism. 1880 Bank has served Dorchester County and the Eastern Shore of Maryland for over 130 years. Originally known as The National Bank of Cambridge, 1880 Bank is stronger than ever as the result of its dedicated team of banking executives who have guided the institution toward a positive financial future. The bank has six conveniently located branch offices on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and now serves Delaware through online banking services.\r\n\r\n“Our new name reflects our local Dorchester County roots but also gives us the flexibility to grow and expand elsewhere on the Shore,” said Kim C. Liddell, Chairman, President and CEO of Delmarva Bancshares, Inc. and 1880 Bank. “In the past four years, we have grown deeper relationships with businesses and individuals in Caroline, Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne’s, Talbot and Wicomico counties, and we believe there is an opportunity for further growth throughout the Delmarva Peninsula.”\r\n\r\nOur success is driven by the local team of employees who deliver professional, hometown service and who provide a strong, safe and sound bank for you to do business with in person or online.

        "description": "OUR PASSION: As part of an honored tradition, upon returning from battle, Marine units always conduct a formal memorial service at Camp Pendleton for their fallen brothers and sisters and for their families. This is the fulfillment of the Marine promise that \"no one is left behind and no one is forgotten.\"  These services, held at the unit's home location, are both beautiful and heartbreaking. These locations become a very special place of remembrance and reflection for the Marines and their families and provide a tranquil setting to gather together, to grieve and to commemorate the loss of their loved ones. In recognition of the service and sacrifice of the 11th Marine Regiment, we want to establish a special place at Las Pulgas specifically designed to honor the proud history of these Marines and Sailors and to serve as a special place of reflection and celebration.\nOUR PURPOSE: To organize and work together with a team to raise donations that will support the construction of a “Ceremonial Garden” area at Camp Las Pulgas aboard Camp Pendleton. This garden will be located between the chapel and Fiddler's Green at Las Pulgas and it will be a serene place to recognize and honor the Marines and Sailors of 11th Marines along with the Regiment's proud history. It will be a quiet venue for veterans, families, and friends to gather and remember their Marines and Sailors, especially those who have given the ultimate sacrifice in past combat. The Ceremonial Garden will also serve as a celebratory site for promotions, award ceremonies, re-enlistments, and retirements, as well as a special place to honor all of our Cannon Cocker veterans.  Our concept includes a two-tiered plaza large enough for formations, visitors, unit emblems and signage to commemorate our veterans and the battles they fought.\nNeither the United States Marine Corps nor any other component of the Department of Defense has approved, endorsed, or authorized the 11th Marines Ceremonial Garden organization.",

We finished with a modern Franke sink, and a detailed Kohler faucet to match the sleekness of the Italian-made coffee machine.☕ https://lnkd.in/gsicrwv",

Our team created a fresh and modern space to cook and gather with family and friends over a large island. We started with structural changes and demolished a load-bearing wall between the kitchen and dining area to create an open concept. Then we built a massive Carrera marble quartz island that is as functional as luxurious looking with a built-in wine cooler, dishwasher, and microwave. Three stylish pendant lights and a dozen of recessed can lights make the room feel larger and brighter. We opted-in for a counter-depth stainless sub-zero refrigerator and encased it with a custom-made cabinet extension. While white is traditional and the most popular color for kitchens, it's easy for such a room to look stark and cold. So our designer mixed glossy white cabinets with gray backsplash tiles and white-gray countertops. We also intermixed it with the natural oak shelves and plant decor to add warm contrasting elements.Read more at https://lnkd.in/eep84pP",

Located in Wabash, Indiana, the theater is both a relic of the past and a modern form of entertainment. Thousands of visitors turn into the 13-24 Drive In each summer to enjoy new blockbusters and retro reels.\n\nThe theater opened in 1951 and has captured the hearts of locals and tourists alike for nearly 70 years. Though much has changed in cinema and automobiles since the theater was founded, a few things remain the same. The facility still features the original ticket booth and concession stand. The 13-24 Drive In still stands on the same 17 acres it was developed on. And on certain nights, you can still catch old classics like The Wizard of Oz or Top Gun.\n\nOpen seasonally from May to September, the 13-24 Drive In offers free admission to kids 12 and under, compliments of INGUARD. Over 50,000 kids and counting have seen films for free. In 2010, longtime supporters of The Honeywell Foundation, Michael and Angie Beauchamp and Parker and Katie Beauchamp, purchased the Drive In with the intent of the Honeywell Foundation operating the facility and receiving all the proceeds.",

If I was a blog post I think I would be tagged as \"dreamer, creative, optimist, idea, believer\", which one would be the biggest in my word cloud is debatable.  I'm originally from Springfield, Illinois, the great Midwest, the pumpkin capital of the world, aka America's Breadbasket.  (Hey we might not have mountains or an ocean to look at, but we still got something.)  Like I said \"optimist\".  I graduated from the University of South Carolina-Aiken with a Bachelor of Fine Arts - majoring in Graphic Design and minoring in Photography.  10dZYNE was born in 2000 to help brings all those ideas of mine to life.  We successfully have over 10 years of professional experience, giving you top quality results every time.  10dZYNE provides a wide range of design and marketing services, from graphic design to web design, marketing tactics to social media implementation. We enjoy being challenged to learn something new everyday and produce only the best that we can.  So I say to you... Bring it on!\n\nWe create.  We design.  We believe.  And We achieve.

Each 2-oz recyclable bottle holds 45 servings or more depending on how strong you make your tea. Most of our teas are matcha-based, and they all dissolve instantly in hot or iced water!\n\nOur Chicago and LA-based company was founded by two tea-loving, tree-hugging, entrepreneurial moms. We realized that billions of tea bags and plastic, quick-brew cups go into landfills each year. This image of waste and environmental doom was what lingered in the back of our minds every time we made a cup of tea.\n\nAnd it suddenly became clear: we had to do something about it. Why can’t we make a delicious tea that won’t harm the environment? Why can’t we marry convenience with a green mindset?\n\nThat’s when 10th Avenue Tea was born. After extensive product development, we found an innovative way to achieve those goals in the form of our U.S. patent-pending product.  Though we were advised to do otherwise, we held firm to our beliefs and developed a tea powder that is free of sugars, fillers and preservatives. When we found a metal shaker bottle that allowed customers to make the tea to their desired strength and was easily recycled, we knew we had the answers we were searching for.",

The initiative partners her with established BIPOC designers and uses 11 Honoré as a platform to help them launch into extended sizing while amplifying their voices in the fashion industry. Kicking off this partnership are LaQuan Smith and Greta Constantine, both successful and celebrated designers, who worked with Danielle and the 11 Honoré team for months to perfect the fit and sizing and to guarantee the initiative was thoughtful every step of the way. Both designers imbued their expertise and artistic vision into each beautifully constructed garment with Danielle acting as the fit model, resulting in stunning collections expertly tailored to fit a wider range of body types. ⁠⁠“As Design Director for 11 Honoré not only is it my responsibility to design for plus size women, who are often ignored in this industry, but as a Black designer it is important that I am a part of ushering other Black designers into the plus space. Black designers and creatives have been overlooked and underrepresented in the fashion industry for far too long, so needless to say this initiative is very close to my heart.” - Danielle Williams-Eke https://lnkd.in/gEShRbu",

After a 30 day quarantine, the horses arrive at our farm frightened, underweight and anxious. They require a lot of TLC and attention to bring them back to health.  They are assessed, cared for and nurtured. Our goal is to re-home them with the perfect owner.  We have a strenuous adoption review process to ensure that the right match is made and the horse will live out the rest of their life free from fear and abuse. \n\nSome horses are selected for our Equine Assisted Therapy program which follows the EAGALA model (no riding).  EAP is an established and proven method of therapy. We focus on Veterans and children and there are many conditions which can be helped through this method.",

We also serve family members, friends, and partners of male survivors.\n\nResearchers estimate that at least 1 in 6 men have been sexually abused or assaulted.\n\nAs it stands, there are limited resources available that speak to the unique challenges faced by men who have been sexually abused or assaulted, such as ingrained myths about manhood, and the social stigma and silence around the issue, which results in a lack of awareness. This means that many men repress their trauma and delay recovery, risking exposure to physical health issues, mental health issues, and social dysfunction.\n\nWe offer a wealth of information related to the effects of and recovery from men's experiences with sexual trauma. Men, friends, and family can chat anonymously with a trained advocate through our national helpline, available 24/7. We also offer weekly online support groups for male survivors, facilitated by a counselor. Our multimedia awareness campaign features portraits and stories of a community of male survivors—aimed at breaking through the isolation, silence, and stigma often connected with the issue. Based in Los Angeles, we also conduct trainings for professionals, organizations, and military branches around the world.\n\nWhen men heal, not only are they able to live happier, healthier lives, but the people around them—including their families, friends, coworkers, and communities—benefit as well. In addition, we believe that men have a responsibility to engage in the movement to end sexual violence of all kinds, and that they will be more likely to do so if their experiences are acknowledged and their healing is supported alongside their bystander efforts.\n\nFor more information and/or support, please visit www.1in6.org.",

                "text": "O Relatório Mundial de Alzheimer, entregue pela AID - Alzheimer's Disease International em 21 de Setembro desse ano, veio iluminar os sinais de alerta da demência, incentivando pessoas a procurarem informações, aconselhamento e apoio com os órgãos competentes do seu país.Um dos dados do relatório é alarmante: 75% dos pacientes com demência, o equivalente a 41 milhões de pessoas, não receberam diagnóstico da patologia. Por outro lado, o mesmo relatório trouxe recomendações que podem auxiliar para que esse número diminua, como a introdução de check-ups anuais da saúde do cérebro para pessoas com mais de 50 anos, com a oportunidade de promover estratégias de redução de risco. Além disso, o registro de diagnósticos com mais precisão deve ser uma busca dos governos em todo o mundo, assim como o de se prepararem para um aumento da demanda por serviços de saúde como resultado do envelhecimento da população global.A medição das taxas de diagnóstico é a chave para o tratamento, cuidado e apoio, para a preparação do sistema de saúde e para desafiar o estigma. Por isso, diagnósticos aprimorados e tratamentos farmacológicos emergentes são imprescindíveis! Segundo a AID \"É apenas através de um esforço verdadeiramente global que podemos aumentar a tão necessária conscientização e desafiar o estigma e a desinformação que ainda envolve a demência.\" (fonte: www.alzint.org)Nesta quarta-feira, vamos receber o Dr. Gustavo Franklin para o Webinar Canabidiol e as Doenças Neurodegenerativas. Além de sua experiência com o tratamento do canabidiol para Alzheimer, o Doutor em Medicina Interna e Ciências da Saúde partilha também seu conhecimento sobre o Parkinson, Huntington, entre outras doenças neurodegenerativas.

                "text": "Milenar e sustentável, o Cânhamo é uma das matérias-primas mais versáteis da indústria.Ainda muito confundido com outra planta da mesma espécie cannabis, as pesquisas disponíveis permitem a conclusão de que o cruzamento seletivo resultou em duas cepas diferentes. O Cânhamo é uma variação genética com características diferentes e possui baixíssimo teor do psicoativo Tetrahidrocanabidiol (THC). Em muitos países, as concentrações dessas substâncias são fixadas por lei, o que estimula o cultivo de linhagens com baixo nível ou mesmo com a total remoção dessa substância das plantas.O mais interessante é que o Cânhamo pode ser cultivado em qualquer solo e não necessita de pesticidas para prosperar, além disso, requer 20% menos água que a cultura do algodão, por exemplo.O Cânhamo é utilizado para a fabricação de alimentos e ingredientes alimentícios. Além disso, é matéria prima para produtos cosméticos, suplementos nutricionais e terapêuticos; tecidos e materiais têxteis. Também pode ser utilizado em diferentes produtos industriais e manufaturados, substituindo cimento, fibra de vidro. Conhecida por sua resistência e durabilidade, a fibra do Cânhamo é produzida a partir do caule, é uma alternativa economicamente competitiva e ambientalmente sustentável.O cânhamo é cultivado conforme o uso pretendido da colheita: das folhas e flores, extraímos os compostos químicos que possuem propriedades medicinais; os canabinóides. Ou seja, o Cânhamo é a matéria prima do 1Pure® Canabidiol Premium!

We’re flexible. We’re creative (but we’re not design divas!) We are always open to our client’s suggestions. We love working as an in-house design team for organizations that need, but don’t have, an on-call team. We meet our deadlines. And we stay on budget.\n\nWe think that’s all just good basic business and deliver that to our clients every day.\n\nOne of our primary competitive differences is that we are an agile and responsive design firm, consisting of two principal designers and an industry-seasoned production manager. With very low overhead and a streamlined project management structure, our responsiveness to your needs will be swift and personal. We are respectful of established brands (and those who uphold them!) and we are easy-going enough to blend in seamlessly with your team to help out in crunch times.\n\nWe work collaboratively with our clients to accomplish their goals. We understand that there are often multiple reviewers for each publication and are happy to work with the consolidated comments and instructions from a team. We ask that each project or publication have a designated staff member as our point of contact.",

We seek to create a safe environment for those who have left, given up or are just bored with church. We follow Jesus and His teachings. We come to search God together, ask the tough questions and explore how the Bible actually applies to our lives. We encourage our congregation to speak their minds, look for answers and move towards building a strong faith in Christ.\n\nWorship\nAt 24-Seven we play music that speaks to us. Our band members and worship leaders are a wonderful group of musicians from various backgrounds that come together to use their talents for God -- from Contemporary Christian and Jazz to Blues and the occasional new rendition of a good old favorite hymn. Our church service is \"come as you are\" -- if you like dressing up.... cool.  If not, we are okay with that too. Tuxedo t-shirts are a good compromise.\n\nCommunity\nAt 24-Seven, community is extremely important to us. We come from all over western Washington, and in order to stay connected we work to build community around each other. The church is a body and we don't want to miss any limbs.",

I was fortunate enough to wander my way through Ireland, England, Scotland, Italy, Germany, Spain, Morocco, and Thailand before coming home to escape the COVID border closures. If I had to choose a specific adventure from that trip, I’d go with either driving the North Coast 500 in the Scottish Highlands or living the island life on Ko Tao, Thailand.Q:  What's your go-to karaoke song? 🎤A:  Rockstar by Smash Mouth all day.Q:  What are your hobbies? 🕺🏻A:  I’m a bit all over the place when it comes to my hobbies. In no particular order: photography, reading, D&D, scuba diving, rock climbing, gaming, disc golf, and dad jokes.",

Affiliation/Franchising might provide some benefits for the real estate agent, such as brand recognition, but it actually does not provide much value to help our customer – YOU, in many cases, costing you more.  Most of them are independent owned like us. Therefore, Home buyers and sellers shouldn’t need to care whose name is on the yard sign, you just want a positive experience, value and results. We offer elite service and exceptional results. Most agents join the team because of the good experiences as a client and wants to pass on the those positive experience to our customers.\r\n\r\n1st Michigan believes that Real estate is not about us but you and the community. giving back to my communities have not only been great experiences for us, but have given us an edge professionally.  our commitment to supporting the local communities and charity organizations not only strengthens our neighborhoods by helping those in need, it keeps us in touch with other industry leaders and trends that can affect the real estate market.\r\n\r\n1st Michigan Realty is a member of National Realtor Association (NAR) and Michigan Realtor Association (MAR).",

        "description": "2020 Connection is a global software company primarily serving the call center industry.   We created this software four years ago to use in our call center and campaign management business.  There weren't many to choose from, so we built our own.  \n1.  Our system calls hundreds of consumers per minute and uses voice recognition to see if they are interested in learning more about your product, service or promotion.  Then your phone rings with ONLY the customers that had a positive response to your message and you complete the conversation with them. \n2. When you want more customers just turn up the dial speed. When you have talked to enough people for the day, turn the system off.  You also control the volume of calls, the timing those calls come in, and the daily costs to acquire those new customers.\n3.  The DECYPHER gives you direct and immediate results.  You turn it on, run it for an hour, or a day and see how many new sales you've made.  You can immediately compare that to the cost of running it for that same amount of time.  No guess work.  The numbers don't lie and they're easy to see.  Most businesses don't know what to attribute growth to, be it signage, radio, tv, website, social media, etc.  Unless you poll your customers, you have no way to MEASURE your 'new customer acquisition' cost.  \n4. Getting started is easy! Upload a dialing list of your target audience, (If you aren't familiar with dialing lists, we can provide a list of company's that specialize in the data you need) record a quick opening message you want your customers to hear, and assign your staff to answer calls. Then, turn it on and wait for calls from customers eager to learn and buy!\n5. I'm sure you are wondering how much this costs. A test to see if it works for you is only $350. No other costs except dialing lists. You keep the sales generated from the test!",

Because we are at a moment in history when the challenges we face are significant, but so are the available resources to tackle them. Yet much of this resource is held in the innovative power of businesses.There are so many businesses already passionately playing their part, from Covid recovery to dealing with climate change. Yet, over the year we found that there were certain reforms that could make a big difference to helping business leaders make a positive difference. The report is summarised with this three point action plan for government and other organisations supporting purpose-driven businesses:1. Provide global leadership on impact measurement to make it easier to report and understand a company’s impact on society.2. Create a clear, obvious legal framework for purpose-driven companies.3. Turbo-charge support for companies wishing to profitably tackle the challenges we face such as recovering from Covid-19, reaching net zero and levelling up the UK.Read the whole paper here https://lnkd.in/dPJd6ah",

Knowledge is power, and executive/entrepreneur Jeremy Westby is the power behind 2911 Enterprises. Westby is the rare individual whose twenty-five years of experience in the music industry champions each of those arenas—on a multi genre level in all realms. After all, how many people can say they’ve worked side by side with Megadeth, Meat Loaf, Micheal W. Smith and Dolly Parton? Westby can.\n\n“I want 2911 to be a change agent in the world: in entertainment, sports, politics, and in many different areas, because I think the world needs to hear good messages,” says Westby. “The world needs healing and inspiration, and if there is a way I can go about my day and provide inspiration, healing, hope, and change, I want to do that.”\n\nAs President & CEO of 2911 Media, Westby continues a working relationship with Country Music Hall of Famers The Oak Ridge Boys that began when he was in college. He also represents country legends Charley Pride, Lee Greenwood, Lacy J. Dalton, and Janie Fricke, pop/rock icons Wanda Jackson, Don McLean and Sam Moore, newcomers Lee Gantt, Sara Spicer, JD Shelburne and Patrick James, and acclaimed musicians Tim Atwood and Kyle Dillingham, among others.\n\n“I created 2911 to be a vehicle for change in the world for the right reasons,” says Westby, who named the company after his favorite, namesake Bible verse, Jeremiah 29:11 -- For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.",

This is a whole new perspective; it's like I have my own personal bank at my disposal.\"\n\nHeadquartered in the Los Angeles financial district together with branches in Orange County and the Inland Empire, 1st Enterprise Bank offers products and services typically only found at much larger, nationwide banks.",

        "description": "1stRateLenders.com was designed with customers, not lenders, in mind. After years of seeing the payday loan industry take advantage of their customers, we saw a way to step in and make a difference.\n\nWe first started by creating a rigorous and detailed lender selection process. This comprehensive selection process is a closely guarded secret ensuring that no online payday lender has an advantage. Of the hundreds of requests we’ve received, only a very small, hand-selected few are good enough to call themselves 1st Rate Lenders. Above anything else, vendors must have a track record of treating their clients ethically and fairly.\n\nWe then designed a system that allows customers to choose from up to 5 hand-selected lenders. We then give those 5 lenders the opportunity to fight for your business.\n\n-1stRateLenders.com is NOT a direct lender and, as such, we see absolutely none of your money.\n-1stRateLenders.com is NOT just another cleverly redesigned website from one of the 1000′s of Payday Lenders.\n-1stRateLenders.com is NOT aligned with any single payday",

These deficiencies can put your department or employees at risk of burnout, injury or – worse case – even line-of-duty deaths, not to mention the less-than-best practices that can bring inefficiency to your operations.\n\nRecognizing the need for a better solution, 2 The Rescue was established to provide field-tested safety techniques and emotional wellness strategies to better prepare your employees for the actual on-the-job experiences that they face each and every day. The latest developments and industry best practices are integral to all that we do.\n\n2 The Rescue training is presented by experienced instructors who have successfully performed all the techniques, strategies and maneuvers live and in the field. The organization’s needs-specific training is at once innovative, cost effective and designed to lay a solid foundation for managing everyday tasks. This includes the life-threatening conflicts and risks that are involved not only in line-of-duty occupations but elsewhere among drivers, educators and others.\n\nThroughout it, we will enhance your ability to properly evaluate a situation and make timely decisions – thereby limiting not only your liability but also more importantly reducing the chance of harmful stress, injury and death to your team.\n\nOur Team and Mission Statement:\nHeaded by two public safety professionals combining more than 45 years of experience, the 2 The Rescue team has witnessed many preventable deaths of co-workers as well as citizens. In light of this, the team’s mission is to reduce these tragedies by presenting affordable, convenient and passionate educational programs that increase awareness, modify behavior and change the attitudes of the civilian and public safety community.",

        "description": "2Fold Doors was originally named Two-Fold, LLC and was formed to sell the 2Fold® product line to consumers, architects, builders developers and resellers throughout the US.  The first product to market was the 2F-8000 movable window wall or bi-folding door system.  2Fold Doors is now a trade style of Mullionz LLC, the company that engineered the system.  \n\nOver the last 2 years, 2Fold® has expanded to be a full-function steel window & door manufacture complete with in-swing and out-swing single and French doors as well as casement, awning and hopper windows.  The line was completed with a mullion and fixed window group to supply the largest of fenestration openings.\n\n2fold® is unique in that it is a hybrid profile system which utilizes fully welded steel sash frames for strength and Accoya® wood for superior thermal properties and unequaled aesthetic appeal on the inside.  It is a hot-rolled steel window/door system by nature with its sashes having only a 1\" wide face profile.\n\nA patent is pending on both this hybrid profile design and the 2.1 locking system that allows for fully concealed cremone (simultaneous top and bottom lock engagement operated by a single lever) locking.  No commercially available hardware would work inside of the very small 1\" sash profile.\n\nThe 2Fold® system has been tested to rigorous standards for air infiltration, water infiltration and structure.  Additionally, the 2F-8000 system is listed with NRFC and qualifies for Energy Star in all 50 states.\n\nWe are at the beginning of a long trail and look forward to consumer and professional input to guide our development.  Get results with the WORLD'S THINNEST DOOR SYSTEM and its cousins.",

By blending interactive safety awareness class instruction together with realistic 3D video, (viewed through our head mounted display unit), our programs capture peoples’ attention and touch them emotionally, resulting in an immediate and lasting positive shift in attitude, mindset and performance. \n\nWhy 3D technology for safety training?  It’s all about impact. Studies have shown that immersive 3D training has a much higher impact on people than traditional training. It is compelling, life-like, and memorable. Our immersion technology puts the participant in the middle of the action and the binaural sound creates hyper-real audio fidelity.  The net effect is to engage the senses and create the space for long-term retention of the information – something that is sorely missing in most of today’s training programs.\n\n3-D ETC can customize our safety training programs to personalize and meet the needs of each client, or create new 3D videos and programs to address key safety issues for your ogranization.\n\nWe offer various delivery options for providing 3D immersive training to our customers - a POD  for 12 participants at a time, a single user Kiosk, or a mobile 2-pack, 6-pack and 12-pack.",

As much as we shy away from failure, it often holds important truths: it helps us learn from our mistakes, allows us to pivot and adapt, and builds character and resilience. This may partly explain why persistence in entrepreneurship pays off; studies find that a defining psychological trait of entrepreneurs is their ability to learn from failure.\"We love these insights!

The key activities of social enterprises often compel widespread change in mindsets and business operations across industries. Social entrepreneurs and their ventures can influence other organizations to take action for impact in three ways:1. Demonstrating that it is viable to do business more sustainably;  Providing inspiration, insights, and offering up new models for replication.2. Building the appeal of circular business models for consumers, employees, and investors.3. Challenging the status quo of what is generally considered acceptable (or not) when it comes to sustainability and inclusiveness.We are thrilled to offer social entrepreneurship programming in collaboration with our long standing partner, The Strome Entrepreneurship Center at Old Dominion University.

Our goal is to also provide a pump track, a mountain bike recreational area, and a radio controlled vehicle park for our community and region. We believe there is a void in our region of fun, safe, and healthy activities that our youth and their families can enjoy for little to no cost. The sport of BMX has been alive since the early 70's and has only grown in popularity since. BMX was the first \"action\" sport to be allowed as an official Olympic sport when it was introduced in 2008. Since then it has paved the way for other \"action\" sports to be considered and allowed into the Olympics. In 2020 the sports of surfing, skateboarding, and sport climbing will be introduced because of the popularity that BMX has brought to the games.",

Within the first year, we formed 309marketing.com. Our goal was the same as our online company, to provide the best solutions, creative messages, and ROI for our clients.

Too often analysis of the North is permeated by inexperience, littered with inaccurate information or grounded in poorly deduced reasoning. We believe no one really knows for sure what is going on in North Korea, but we can at least try to understand the possibilities. Similarly, anyone who professes certainty should be viewed with the greatest skepticism.\n\nTo accomplish these objectives, 38 North harnesses the experience of long-time observers of North Korea and others who have dealt directly with North Koreans. It draws on other experts outside the field who might bring fresh, well-informed insights to those of us who follow North Korea.\n\n38 North covers not only North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction, but digs beneath the surface of political, economic, social and other developments. North Korea is not a hermit kingdom, but rather a country that has been in the throes of change, good and bad, for over a decade. Those changes have important implications for the Korean peninsula, the East Asian region and the international community.\n\n38 North strives as much as possible for ideological balance, publishing opposing opinions, and utilizes various technologies to analyze military, economic, social and other developments north of the DMZ. While it is an American-based project, it draws on experts from around the world to provide international perspectives as well.",

        "description": "3D Predict is a clear aligner manufacturer. Our aligners are driven by artificial intelligence that predictably helps treat ALL cases of complexity. Yep, we can do what most people think only braces can do! Working to boost treatment effectiveness and reduce the number of refinements, our team created software driven by artificial intelligence (AI) called Deep CBCT Analysis.We saw a way to combine clinical experience and cutting-edge AI technology to equip orthodontists with an aligner that helps treat even the most complex cases with greater precision and efficiency.With Deep CBCT Analysis, orthodontists can effectively straighten teeth while keeping them within the alveolar housing — looking beyond a tooth crown to see the real roots and bone. This AI-driven software creates highly precise 3D models of crowns, bones, and actual roots with every detail of the apex visible so each tooth can be deeply analyzed like never before. By seeing how roots will move versus the bone during treatment, orthodontists are able to achieve more predictable and safe outcomes for patients unlike anything else that’s currently available on the market.3D Predict was founded by Dr. Marina Domracheva. Her passion for mathematics drives our work in advanced technology to improve clinical effectiveness in dental care. Dr. Domracheva identified a gap in tooth straightening propositions available on the market and founded 3D Predict to inspire orthodontists to see the unseen and allow them to look beyond the evidence in treatment planning. Our clinical experts and 3D plan modeling technicians are among the best in the industry, the majority receiving deep orthodontic education.",

These are our 4 steps to achieving a goal.\n\nOur main priority is to provide realistic guidance and advice to rising high school student-athlete, getting their their names out there and noticed by recruiting college and universities. We launch a progressive plan of clear  initiatives for sport faculties of potential schools to become exposed to available talent and ultimately, provide the opportunity for possible scholarship. In full compliance with the NCAA, we serve as a bridge to possible success.\n\nWe create an individualized plan for each of our clients in order to further their collegiate endeavors as academic scholars prepared for college and as athletes prepared to contribute to an institution's athletics. We provide realistic, experience-supported, and results-driven guidance in the following: fitness and training, diet and nutrition, standardized exam preparation, academic and study skills. We structure a plan of present- and future-oriented steps towards promoting each student-athlete's unique talents to potential schools looking to provide sport scholarships. Recruitment requires knowledge & exposure - this is why we are here.\n\nWe provide the following services: personalized 1-1 advisory sessions, academic and physical fitness, performance evaluation and follow-up consultation, drill and game filming and video editing, academic portfolio assistance, high school resume advice for college admissions, interview practice, standardized exam prep, fitness training and diet counseling, transparent communication and realistic college and career advice based on student merit and goals, document transfer and communication to-and-from potential schools. \n\n4'n Goal's mission is simple. We want everyone to succeed throughout all walks of life. We pride ourselves upon our clients' success. Their success is our success!\n\nAdvising/Counseling – Where we shine is giving real life advice based on real-world experiences, but to counsel you on the possible dangers that could stop each client from reaching their goals. Our advice does not only pertain to the student-athlete, but the parents as well. We strive to educate you on the right questions that you should be asking each college coach and admissions counselor.\n\nOur Mission – Is to see that each client is in the correct school that fits with what they want to do for their future. Our job is not to see that you receive a scholarship, but to see that each client is getting the right education that is going to lead to a possible great career.\n\nCompany policies – One of our most important policies is communication on both sides (us and our client). We can not function without communication. We also like to stay in full contact with our clients' parents (*not the student-athlete). We feel that our one-on-one sessions need to be the time for them to ask us question that they have been thinking. The parents are the backbone to their student-athletes' success; we are just another tool to help sharpen the edge of their minds. We do not discriminate on gender, sex, religion or creed.\n\nMilitary service – Currently we have a member that is serving in our Armed Forces for our country. That member will not be available at certain times throughout the year. Schedules and times will be discussed and given to our clients.",
